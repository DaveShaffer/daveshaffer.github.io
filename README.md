# DAVE SHAFFER'S PORTFOLIO

### General Assembly WDI6
### March - June 2016
### Atlanta, GA

> I am a student of the world, curious about all aspects of culture and science.  My background is in computer science and electrical engineering.  I'm an actor and I've worked in the music business.  I know my way around a kitchen and I traveled the world while working for an airline.  I know computer hardware, software and network protocols.  It's exciting how fast technology is evolving and I can't wait to see what happens next.  I attended web development boot camp at General Assembly where I learned the latest versions of HTML, CSS, jQuery, Angular.js, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, GitHub, Heroku, Ruby on Rails and MEAN stack.
